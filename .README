# Consensus mechanism simplified
Blockchains utilize different mechanisms in order to achieve consensus(agreement). But in understanding these mechanism, we have to first understand the need for consensus.

In a system where anyone is welcome to participate, like in the case of public blockchain networks, there has to be a way for the participant of the network to agree on the state of the blockchain.

The state of the blockchain is altered by transactions, that are then packed into blocks that are cryptographically connected to the already agreed upon chain (canonical chain).

In a situation where a participant of the network alters the state of the blockchain without the agreement of other participants, their is said to be no consensus. 

What about in situations where groups of participants in the network agree on a particular state of the blockchain and other groups disagree?

Consensus mechanism is how different blockchains determine which group wins and what the correct state of the blockchain is.


## Using bitcoin and ethereum as case study
Bitcoin and Ethereum are both public blockchains in which anyone is welcome to participate, with a caveat. Not every participant would be allowed to alter the state of the blockchain.

>Remember, consensus is needed when there is an attempt to alter the state of the blockchain. 

### Bitcoin
The only nodes who can alter the state of the bitcoin blockchain are nodes with sufficient computational power to solve the mathematical puzzle posed by the bitcoin network when attempting to make those state changes. 

This process is know as **proof-of-work (PoW)**

When a node is successfully able to solve the mathematical puzzle, the node broadcasts the new block to other participating nodes who then perform neccessary verifications before adding the block to their individual chains.

The canonical chain is determined after this process has occured multiple times. Through cryptography, a node can ascertain that other nodes have the same chain, hence consensus.

In the case of divergent chains, where different groups of nodes seem to be working on different chains, bitcoin uses the longest chain rule.

The longest chain rule implies that the chain that has the highest proof-of-work is the canonical chain.

>Hence, the concensus mechanism in bitcoin is a combination of what i will call a "pre-consensus process" i.e PoW and the main consensus mechanism which involves the verification and addition of blocks to the individual node chains and the longest chain rule.

This whole process, pre-consensus + main consensus process, for bitcoin is know as **Nakamoto's consensus**.

### Ethereum
In other for a node to be able to propose a change of state to the ethereum blockchain, that node must have at least **32 ETH** staked on the ethereum network, **proof-of-stake (PoS)**.

Unlike bitcoin, the nodes who proposes the next block is chosen randomly from a group of eligible nodes and are known as validators. 

Consensus is determined in ethereum by a group of validator nodes who attest to the proposed block by the chosen block proposer and then broadcasts to the network that the block has been validated or not. Every node still validates the block before adding it to their respective chains. 

>Here, the canonical chain is determined by a committee of validators. Other nodes follow, though they still perform validation individually and refuse to add blocks to their chain if malicious activities is detected.

Validators use a consensus mechanism know as Gasper to determine the canonical chain in case of a divergence. Gasper determines the rules of consensus every ethereum node follows

[Gasper](https://ethereum.org/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/gasper/) is a combination of Casper-FFG and LMD-GHOST fork choice algorithm. 

Together these components form the consensus mechanism securing proof-of-stake Ethereum. Casper is the mechanism that upgrades certain blocks to "finalized" so that new entrants into the network can be confident that they are syncing the canonical chain. The fork choice algorithm uses accumulated votes to ensure that nodes can easily select the correct one when forks or divergence arise in the blockchain.
